[D#m][C#][B][F#]

{comment:Verse 1}
[D#m]Before I spoke a [C#]word, You were singing [B]over me
[D#m]You have been [C#]so, so good to [B]me
[D#m]Before I took a [C#]breath, You breathed Your [B]life in me
[D#m]You have been [C#]so, so kind to [B]me

{start_of_chorus}
{comment:Chorus}
Oh, the [D#m]overwhelming, [C#]never-ending, [B]reckless love of [F#]God
Oh, it [D#m]chases me down, [C#]fights ‘til I’m found, [B]leaves the ninety-[F#]nine
I couldn’t [D#m]earn it, I don’t de[C#]serve it, still You [B]give Yourself [F#]away
Oh, the [D#m]overwhelming, [C#]never-ending, reck[B]less love of [F#]God
{end_of_chorus}


{comment:Verse 2}
[D#m]When I was Your [C#]foe, still Your love foug[B]ht for me
[D#m]You have been [C#]so, so good to [B]me
[D#m]When I felt no [C#]worth, You paid it all for me   [B]
[D#m]You have been [C#]so, so kind to [B]me

{comment:Bridge. First time through all on the [D#m]}
[D#m]There’s no shadow You won’t [C#]light up
Mountain You won’t cl[B]imb up
Coming after [F#]me
[D#m]There’s no wall You won’t [C#]kick down
Lie You won’t t[B]ear down
Coming after [F#]me
