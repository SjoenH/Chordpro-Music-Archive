[Verse 1]
What fortune lies beyond the stars
Those dazzling heights too vast to climb
I got so high to fall so far
But I found heaven as love swept low

[Chorus]
{start_of_chorus}
    My heart beating My soul breathing
    I found my life When I laid it down
    Upward falling
    Spirit soaring
    I touch the sky
    When my knees hit the ground
{end_of_chorus}

[Interlude 1x]

[Verse 2]
What treasure waits within Your scars
The gift of freedom gold canâ€™t buy
I bought the world and sold my heart
You traded heaven to have me again

[Chorus]
[Interlude 2x]

[Bridge]
Find me here at Your feet again
Everything I am
Reaching out I surrender
Come sweep me up in Your love again
And my soul will dance
On the wings of forever

[Chorus]
