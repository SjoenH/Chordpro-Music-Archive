[G]   Our God is the Lion the [D/F#]Lion of [Em]Judah
He's roaring in power and [D]fighting our [C]battles
And every knee will [D]bow before Him
[G]   Our God is the Lamb the [D/F#]Lamb that was [Em]slain
For the sins of the world His [D]blood breaks the [C]chains
And every knee will [D]bow before the Lion and the [C]Lamb
Oh Every knee will [D]bow before Him
