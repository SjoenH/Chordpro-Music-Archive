{comment:Verse 1}
[B] Have you ever seen the wonder
In the glimmer of first sight
As the eyes begin to [E]open
And the blindness [G#m7]meets the light[E]
If you have so say

{start_of_chorus}
{comment:Chorus 1}
[B] I see the world in light
I see the world in wonder
I see the world in life
Bursting in living color
[E] I see the world Your way
And I’m walking in the [B]light
{end_of_chorus}

{comment:Verse 2}
Have you ever seen the wonder
In the air of second life
Having come out of the [E]waters
With the old one [G#m7]left behind
If you have so say

{comment:REPEAT CHORUS 1}
{comment:Post-Chorus}
[G#m] I see the world in grace
I see the world in gospel 
[E] I see the world Your way
and I’m walking in the [B]light
I’m walking in the wonder
You’re the wonder in the [E]wild
Turning wilderness to [B]wonder
If You have so [E]say
[G#m] I see the world in love
I see the world in freedom
[E] I see the Jesus way
You’re the wonder in the [B]wild

{comment:Bridge}
I see the world Your way
and I’m not afraid to follow
I see the world Your way
and I’m not ashamed to say so
[E] I see the Jesus way
and I’m walking in the [B]light
