[D]You were the Word at the beginning

Now re[G]vealed in [Bm]You our [A]Christ

[D]You didn't want heaven without us
So Jesus [G]You brought [Bm]heaven [A]down
[Bm]My sin was great Your [A/C#]love was great[D]er
What could [G]separ[Bm]ate us [A]now?

Death could not [G]hold You 
The veil tore be[A]fore You 
You silence the [Bm]boast of sin and [F#m]grave
The heavens are [G]roaring the praise of Your [A]glory
For You are [Bm]raised to life [A]again
You have no [G]rival, You have no [A]equal 
Now and for[Bm]ever God You [F#m]reign
Yours is the [G]kingdom, Yours is the [A]glory
Yours is the [Bm]Name above all [A]Names
