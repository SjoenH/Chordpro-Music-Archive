{comment:Verse 1}
All these [Em]pieces
Broken and [G]scattered
In mercy [Em]gathered
Mended and [G]whole
Empty [Em]handed
But not [G]forsaken
I've been set [D]free
I've been set [Em]free [D]

{comment:Pre-Chorus 1}
A[C]mazing grace
How [D]sweet the sound
That [Em]saved a wretch like [C]me
I [C]once was lost
But [D]now I am found
Was [Em]blind but now I [C]see

{start_of_chorus}
{comment:Chorus}
Oh I can see You [G]now [D]
Oh I can see the [Em]love in Your [C]eyes
Laying Yourself [G]down [D]
Raising up the [Em]broken to [C]life
{end_of_chorus}


{comment:Verse 2}
You take our [Em]failure
You take our [G]weakness
You set Your [Em]treasure
In jars of [G]clay
So take this [Em]heart, Lord
I'll be Your [G]vessel
The world to [D]see Your life [Em]in me[D]
