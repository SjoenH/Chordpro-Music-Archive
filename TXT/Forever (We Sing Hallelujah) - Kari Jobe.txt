Verse 1
[Ab]   The moon and stars they [Ebadd4]wept
The morning sun was [Fm]dead
The Savior of the [Db]world was fall[Ab]en                     
His body on the [Ebadd4]cross 
His blood poured out for [Fm]us
The weight of every [Db]curse upon [Ab]Him

{comment:REPEAT INTRO}

{comment:Verse 2}
[Ab]   One final breathe He [Ebadd4]gave 
As heaven looked [Fm]away
The Son of God was [Db]laid
in dark[Ab]ness                             
A battle in the [Ebadd4]grave
The war on death was [Fm]waged
The power of hell for[Db]ever broken


{comment:Pre-Chorus}                             
[Ab]   The ground began to [Eb]shake 
The stone was rolled [Fm7]away
His perfect love could [Db]not be overcome
[Ab/C]   Now death where is your [Eb]sting
Our resurrected [Fm7]King
Has rendered you de[Db]feated

{start_of_chorus}
{comment:Chorus}
For[Absus]ever [Ab]He is [Ebadd4]glorified
For[Fm7]ever He is [Db2]lifted high
For[Absus]ever [Ab]He is [Ebadd4]risen
He is a[Fm7]live, He is a[Db2]live
